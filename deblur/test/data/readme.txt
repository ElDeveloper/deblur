70_otus.fasta - the 70% representative set from greengenes 13.5

seqs_s1.fa - a simulated dataset with 100 reads derived from simset.s1.fasta using art
seqs_s2.fa - a simulated dataset with 200 reads derived from simset.s2.fasta using grinder, with 10% chimeras, and additionally 35 phix reads

simset.s1.fasta - 10 sequences from greengenes 13.5, selected randomly with >0.5 similarity to seed sequence
simset.s2.fasta - 10 sequences from greengenes 13.5, selected randomly with >0.9 similarity to seed sequence
